# 🌊 Flood Evacuation Planning System  
**SDG Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable**

---

## 📘 Project Description
This project is designed to assist communities during floods by providing a system to mark flooded areas, view statuses, manage emergency alerts, and plan evacuation routes.  

We applied **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to ensure efficiency and reliability:
- **Arrays**: Mark and reset flood status for barangays.  
- **Array Traversal / Linked List**: Display flooded areas and store barangays for route planning.  
- **Searching Algorithm**: Find the shortest and safest evacuation routes.  
- **Queue (FIFO)**: Manage emergency alerts and clear them in order.
